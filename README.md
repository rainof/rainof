# Hi there 👋

I'm Fon, a software developer passionate about robotics, AI, and human-computer interaction. I enjoy exploring **UX/UI design**, **lifelong learning**, and **emerging technologies** while solving real-world problems through code. I believe in **learning by doing** and use **AI as a supporter** to enhance my development process. My focus is on frontend development, where I build intuitive, accessible, and performant web applications.

I also have research experience in **usability systems for end-users in robotics**, which deepened my understanding of user needs and interaction design—skills I bring into frontend development to create seamless user experiences.


🔥 - Creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces.

⭐ - Passionate about design systems & web performance.

🧩 - Exploring the intersection of AI, HCI, and frontend development.

🚀 - Always learning, experimenting, and improving!
